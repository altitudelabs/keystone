      Standardized tests can't measure initiative, creativity, imagination, conceptual thinking, curiosity, effort, irony, judgment, commitment, nuance, good will, ethical reflection, or a host of other valuable dispositions and attributes. What they can measure and count are isolated skills, specific facts and function, content knowledge, the least interesting and least significant aspects of learning.

          Of all the obstacles on the road to higher education, standardized tests often fill students with more anxiety and apprehension not to mention stress than any other. Yet, it is also the easiest one to overcome if the student has the right attitude. As Bill Ayers summarized, standardized tests like the SAT and ACT measure isolated skills that can be honed and perfected so that students can reach their maximum potential.

          Our approach is built on the three Rs: Recognition, Repetition, and Review. We build our test prep programs around these core study habits to help students recognize patterns specific to standardized tests, reinforce understanding through tailored repetition, and inculcate the skills for longevity through offline and online review programs.

          In enrichment programs, we aim to address the very concerns that Bill Ayers allude to. There are different levels of knowledge that a student must master in order to make significant improvement not only in their studies, but their lives.

          Consultation in the education business is relatively a new industry. But with growing competitiveness of application pool at boarding schools and colleges, the industry has exploded in the last decade with new consulting firms popping up every day. The first to offer the holistic consultation in Korea, Keystone Consulting has enjoyed unparalleled success in placing kids at top boarding schools and universities, but more importantly, we have excelled in placing students in schools where they could succeed. The fit, an often overlooked concept in private consulting, is an important aspect of the services we provide. With such a growing number of students unable to cope with the rigors of the academic institutions they find themselves in, we put a great deal of emphasis on providing an holistic mentorship and guidance that seeks to identify, motivate, and prepare ultimately in order to help students mature and be ready for life in college and beyond.
