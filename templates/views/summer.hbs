    This summer we will be offering a full program of courses in standardized testing, writing skills, and subject previews. We will be opening courses for students preparing to take the SAT, ACT, or SSAT exams in the coming months, as well as our Cornerstone program, designed as a holistic literature and humanities approach to building critical thinking skills. In addition, we will hold a Writing course for high school students looking to improve their analytical writing skills for various academic pursuits.
