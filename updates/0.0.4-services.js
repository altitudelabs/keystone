The program not only builds a solid academic foundation for improvement in the here and now but also expands the potential of its students to perform at an even higher level in the future. Cornerstone has been tailor-made to help students maintain their GPA along with holistically developing skills that will translate into higher standardized test scores. The program consists of 3 levels: 100, 200, 300. Each level builds in students a unique skill set necessary to achieving excellence at every level of schooling. Cornerstone\u0026rsquo;s aim has and always will be to transform its students into conscious, passionate and capable individuals who can succeed in the classroom and more importantly in life.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch2\u003eCornerstone 100: Understanding\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eCornerstone 100 is the most fundamental level which allows students to develop skills in understanding the general framework of a text through characters and themes. The literature portion of class focuses on testing a student\u0026rsquo;s general grasp of the language through evidence-based reading, quotation selection and introductory level close reading analysis while humanities gives students a chance to be exposed to U.S. history through primary and secondary source readings.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch2\u003eCornerstone 200: Critical Thinking\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eCornerstone 200 is the program\u0026rsquo;s intermediate level which allows students to develop inference and critical thinking skills to understand the subtext and deeper meaning of a work. At this level, the literature portion of class moves away from general understanding to close reading analysis, literary terms, citation-based writing and a taste of visual analysis. The humanities section continues student learning in evidence-based reading through longer texts that touch on a variety of subject matter such as science, business and technology.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch2\u003eCornerstone 300: Synthesis\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eCornerstone 300 is the program\u0026rsquo;s highest level which allows students to develop skills in synthesizing different texts and sources from a variety of disciplines to create a new whole. At this level, literature and humanities work together to bring about a greater understanding of a text and its themes. Students use close reading analysis, visual analysis and evidence-based reading to ultimately create a longer citation-based essay. Subject matter is chosen according to time period and cut across disciplines as varied as political science, philosophy, psychology, science and history.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch2\u003eCornerstone Math\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eCornerstone Math is a program specifically designed to help young students develop a strong base in fundamental mathematics to provide an easier path to advanced mathematics in boarding school, upper level high school math, and standardized tests. The program combines problem set drilling with theory and application, and this delicate balance will prove to be an invaluable skill set for students in the future.\u003c/p\u003e"

However, not all GPA is created equal; universities take into account the rigor of the student's high school curriculum when assessing the value of a student's GPA. Students who wish to gain admissions to top tier universities abroad must strive to receive high grades while undertaking the most challenging courses that they can handle. For example, a 4.0 GPA in an AP level course load is valued higher than a 4.0 GPA in a standard course load.

This allows students to take on advanced level coursework in high school and perform at their highest level, while also freeing up their time to focus and prepare for standardized tests that are required for university admissions.

However, this is aligned with its past practice: every ten years or so, College Board goes through a redesign of its college entrance exam, the current one having been implemented exactly ten years ago. While the public is debating whether the revisions would make the test a better indicator of college performance for high school kids, students and parents are more concerned with a more practical question: is it harder or easier?\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe simple answer is, it is both. In certain sections, and for certain groups, the test would be easier. One of the first changes you\u0026rsquo;d notice about the reading section is that it will no longer test you on obscure words through sentence completion questions. In this regard, students with a less than stellar vocabulary or has problem memorizing 3000+ words, they\u0026rsquo;d find the test easier to digest. But that also means, they\u0026rsquo;ve taken away the one portion of the reading section that students could actually study for in a relatively short period of time and see meaningful improvements.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003ePassage-based questions will also go through revisions, but based on the blueprint released by the College Board, the concepts tested will remain pretty much the same with two notable exceptions: the inclusion of graphical data and incorporation of grammar-based questions into the reading passage. The College Board has announced that the passages themselves will be of different stock, for example, the use of Founding documents, but in all likelihood, the questions would require the same basic critical reading skills.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eEssays have definitely become more difficult as it has moved away from its argumentative format to an analytical one. It now requires the students to critically read and analyze a passage, a task that requires a combination of both reading and writing skills of the highest order. While it is denoted as being optional, the essay would in all likelihood be required by most top universities as it is currently the case with the ACT optional essay.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eKeystone\u0026rsquo;s response to the changes has been an in-house development of both short-term and long-term training regimen that focuses on the primary objective of the redesigned SAT, evidence-based reading and writing, and on the fundamental skills common in both the old and the new models.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch1\u003eSubject Tests\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n\u003cdiv class=\"paragraph no-padding\"\u003eSubject Test preparation classes are run in both group and private 1:1 sessions.
